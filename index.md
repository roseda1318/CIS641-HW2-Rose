## Technical Background 
The first coding experience I had was in high school when I was making money off of customizing people's myspace profiles. Many many manny years later I was teaching in a small rural town where there were no computer science classes. I thought that it would be cool to offer one. With the help of code.org and the patience of an awesome group of high school kids we all learned how to code JavaScript together. 

I have done some basic work with drones (FAA certified), and minimal exploration in python. My first formal training in a language was 2 years after I started teaching CS when I started this grade program and learned Java (501). My only other experience is in the mobile app development class, and a few projects here and there. 

I am now teaching AP-Computer Science Principles for the 4th year. 

## Pixel Art Project
The application that my team is creating is a pixel project that will allow users to express their creativity. This application will have an 8x8 grid of cells that will allow the user to select colors to change the cell to the chosen color. 

Users will have the ability to use the application both online and offline as well as save and accesses their creations at any given time. The shake feature will serve as an eraser to undo the previous action.
